<p class="left_hdx" id="sy_17"><a href="content.html#syn_17">THE IMPORTANCE OF READING   A LOT!</a></p>
<p class="noindent">One of the best ways to build your vocabulary is to read authentic English language material. You should read material that a college student would read. Examples of such material are newspapers, college textbooks, encyclopedia articles, magazines, and academic books. Any material that has an academic theme will help you to get used to the kinds of words and the style of writing you will find on the TOEFL. Reading articles on a variety of topics of interest to you will help you to develop your vocabulary. Pay attention to new groups of words, expressions, and phrases you encounter in your reading. Take advantage of resources—teachers, native speakers of English—to learn their meanings.</p>
<p class="left_hdx" id="sy_18"><a href="content.html#syn_18">MAKE FLASH CARDS</a></p>
<p class="noindent">As you are reading, you will find new words that you will want to learn. One good way to learn words is to make flash cards. Use small cards made of thick paper. The cards should be small enough to fit in your pocket. On one side write the new word or group of words, then on the back write a synonym, a word or words that have the same meaning. For example, expressions such as “run a risk” and “take a chance” are similar in meaning: they are synonyms. You may also want to note the definition of the words you put on your flash cards. Review these cards as often as you can, perhaps with a friend who is also preparing for the TOEFL. You will be able to build a large “sight vocabulary” by using this method. Do not be concerned if you are unable to actually use these words in conversations you have in English. With time, they will become a part of your active vocabulary. The ability to use new words is not as important as your ability to recognize new words and their meanings.</p>
<p class="left_hdx" id="sy_19"><a href="content.html#syn_19">MAKE WORD LISTS</a></p>
<p class="noindent">Another good way to learn new words is to make word lists. Many students use a small notebook for this purpose. When you discover a new word, or group of words, add it to a list of words to be learned. On one side of the page, list the new words. To the right of this list, write synonyms for the new words. Study the words by covering the synonyms, looking at the new word, and recalling the synonyms. It is also useful to reverse the process so that you practice both the new words and their synonyms.</p>
<p class="left_hdx" id="sy_20"><a href="content.html#syn_20">LEARN WORDS FROM OLD TOEFLs</a></p>
<p class="noindent">Learn words that have been tested on previous TOEFLs. The underlined words on previous TOEFL tests are sometimes tested again, but they frequently appear among the four choices presented as synonyms for new words that are tested. You can find words to put on your flash cards or word lists on any TOEFL tests that you have. TOEFL tests can be found online and in the TOEFL test kits available from the Educational Testing Service.</p>
<p class="left_hdx" id="sy_21"><a href="content.html#syn_21">LEARN THE WORDS IN THIS BOOK</a></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Include all of the words listed in this book on your cards and lists.</span> These words have been carefully researched and selected, and many will appear on the TOEFL.</p>
<p class="indent">You should learn prefixes, suffixes, and word roots. For a list of them, see Chapter 4. Suggestions for studying word roots, suffixes, and prefixes can be found in that chapter.</p>
<p class="left_hdx" id="sy_22"><a href="content.html#syn_22">LEARN TO USE A THESAURUS</a></p>
<p class="noindent">Become familiar with a thesaurus. A thesaurus is a word list of synonyms. When you find a word that you don’t know, look it up in the thesaurus. Note a synonym for the word on a card or a word list. If you find a synonym, but still don’t know the meaning of the word, look it up in a print or online English language dictionary. <span class="italic">If you can’t find the word in the thesaurus, it will not be tested on the TOEFL</span>. The TOEFL tests only those words that have a variety of synonyms. For more information about the use of a thesaurus, see Chapter 4.</p>
