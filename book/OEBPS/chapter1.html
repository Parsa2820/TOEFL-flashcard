<h3 class="left_hdv" id="sy_2"><a href="content.html#syn_2"><span class="bold">WHAT IS THE TOEFL?</span></a></h3>
<p class="noindenta">The TOEFL is a comprehensive English language examination that helps colleges and universities in the United States, Canada, and other parts of the world make admission decisions. It is also used by some organizations to certify professionals to practice their vocations both in the United States and abroad.</p>
<h3 class="left_hd" id="sy_3"><a href="content.html#syn_3"><span class="bold">ABOUT THE</span> <span class="bold">i</span><span class="bold">BT (INTERNET-BASED TOEFL)</span></a></h3>
<p class="noindent">For many years, the TOEFL was administered only in a paper-based format. Examinees marked their answers with a pencil on an answer sheet. The test primarily assessed listening comprehension, grammar, vocabulary, and reading skills. Then, beginning in 1998, the Educational Testing Service (the maker of the TOEFL) began offering a computer-based TOEFL known as the iBT. Taking advantage of advances in technology, the iBT expanded the range of skills tested by adding speaking and writing sections to the test as well as integrating reading, grammar, and vocabulary skills to mimic how we use language everyday.</p>
<h3 class="left_hd" id="sy_4"><a href="content.html#syn_4"><span class="bold">ABOUT THE ITP TOEFL (INSTITUTIONAL TOEFL PROGRAM)</span></a></h3>
<p class="noindent">Some educational institutions use a paper-based TOEFL, known as the ITP TOEFL. The Educational Testing Service makes this form of the TOEFL available to institutions who often use the test to generally assess individuals’ English language skills for placement purposes. Institutions also use results to assess the effectiveness of their English language instructional programs. These TOEFLs are typically previously administered paper-based TOEFLs. Generally, colleges and universities do not accept ITP TOEFL scores in place of an iBT score. The two versions of the TOEFL are quite different. A description of both formats follows.</p>

<h3 class="left_hd" id="sy_6"><a href="content.html#syn_6"><span class="cap-bold">SECTION 1: READING</span></a></h3>
<p class="noindentz">The iBT reading section is presented in two formats. The short format iBT gives you three passages of approximately 700 words. The long format contains four passages. After each passage, you will answer 12–14 test questions. If you are taking the long format iBT, only three sets of the test questions will be answered. The responses to the questions for the other two passages will be evaluated by ETS for use on future iBTs. You will have 60 minutes to read all of the passages and respond to the questions (100 minutes for the long format). You will be allowed to take notes while you read. You will see some words or phrases highlighted. You may see an explanation or definition of the word or phrase by clicking on it.</p>
<p class="indentz">The majority of questions in this section are in the multiple-choice format. Make your answer choice for each and proceed to the next question by clicking on <span class="bold">Next</span>. To return to the previous question, click on <span class="bold">Back</span>. At any time, you can click on <span class="bold">Review</span> to see a list of the questions that you have and have not answered. You may return to any question while you are working on this section, but once you have left the reading section, you may not return to it. A clock will appear on the screen to help you manage your time</p>
<p class="indentz">In this section, you first read the passage completely. You do so by using the scroll bar to view the entire passage on the screen. The computer will not give you the questions until you have scrolled the entire reading selection. At that point, click on <span class="bold">Next</span>.</p>
<p class="indentz">There are different response formats in the reading section. These involve clicking on a word, phrase, or sentence. Vocabulary items are usually tested by asking you to click on another word in the text that means the same thing as a bolded word. Sometimes you will be asked to click on a sentence or group of sentences where the answer to a particular question can be found. Sometimes, you may be asked to insert a sentence into the text. On cohesion items, you will be asked to click on the word or phrase in the bolded part of the passage that the cohesion word refers to. After you click on the word or phrase, it will darken.</p>
<p class="indentz">Finally, the newest type of test question (“reading to learn”) will require you to complete a summary or fill in a chart by selecting which provided text options to include. The summary questions are worth up to two points each and the chart questions are worth three to four points, depending on whether five or seven options are presented.</p>
<h3 class="left_hd" id="sy_7"><a href="content.html#syn_7"><span class="cap-bold">SECTION 2: LISTENING</span></a></h3>
<p class="noindenta">The listening section of the iBT tests your ability to understand spoken English that is typically found on the campuses of colleges and universities. The listening tasks are those that are typical of social and academic conversations found in these settings.</p>
<p class="indentz">There are two formats for the listening section. In the short listening section, you will hear two conversations and four lectures. The long format contains three conversations and six lectures. Each conversation and lecture requires you to respond to five or six questions, most of which are multiple choice. The responses to the questions of the extra conversation and lectures do not count. The questions will be evaluated by ETS for use on future iBTs. Since you do not know which passages will count, it is important for you to do your best on all of the test questions. You have 25 minutes on the short format listening section and 30 on the long format section. A clock appears on the screen to help you manage your time. It does not include the time while you are listening to the lectures and conversations.</p>
<p class="indentz">You will hear each lecture and conversation and each of the questions only one time. You are allowed to take notes as you listen and use them to answer questions. Once a question is answered, you are not allowed to return to it, so be sure to choose your answers carefully.</p>
<p class="indentz">On the iBT, stimuli will come to you through headphones, not through an audio CD as is the case with the ITP TOEFL. On the iBT, you will both see and hear each question; on the ITP TOEFL, you only hear the question. Following the question, the answer choices appear on the screen; the question stays on the screen until you have made your response. For multiple-choice items, each option is preceded by an oval [<span class="symbol"><img alt="image" src="Images/cir.jpg"/></span>], instead of the letters (A), (B), (C), or (D).</p>
<p class="indentz">On the iBT, you will be told both the context and the topic of the conversation. The extended conversations typically involve a main presenter who gives the information, and one or two other persons who ask questions of the main presenter. All speakers are pictured on the screen. Each stimulus is normally followed by three or four questions on what was said.</p>
<p class="indentz">The iBT lectures also include an introduction that tells you who is speaking and the topic. Going back to the minitalk on Chicago, the introduction might be as follows:</p>
<p class="block_1">“Listen to a tour guide as he tells a group of visitors about the city of Chicago.”</p>
<p class="indentz">In the iBT lectures, the presentations usually simulate a lecture by a professor who is using visuals. The professor and the visuals are depicted on the screen. Using your mouse, you answer each question, after it is asked.</p>
<p class="indentz">The iBT uses a greater variety of response types. For example, there may be more than one correct answer and you will be asked to click on the oval next to all correct answers. Whenever there is more than one correct answer, you will be told how many correct answers you should identify. To see an example, read the minitalk about <a href="#Chicago">Chicago</a>. Then answer the following question:</p>
<p class="noindent_b">What can be inferred about the weather in Chicago?</p>
<p class="noindent_bb">(Click on 2 answers)</p>
<p class="list_cir"><img alt="image" src="Images/cir.jpg"/> It is influenced by a glacier.</p>
<p class="list_cir"><img alt="image" src="Images/cir.jpg"/> Summers are unpleasantly warm.</p>
<p class="list_cir"><img alt="image" src="Images/cir.jpg"/> The wind is usually accompanied by cold.</p>
<p class="list_cir"><img alt="image" src="Images/cir.jpg"/> It is very dry during the winter months.</p>
<p class="list_cir"><img alt="image" src="Images/cir.jpg"/> It is temperate and stable.</p>
<p class="indentt">In the above example, you would click on the oval to the left of second and third statement.</p>
<p class="indentz">Sometimes, a response format is visual. In that case, you click on the correct visual with your mouse. Sometimes, a response will involve matching. In that case, you must classify each new piece of information you are given into three or four categories, according to classifications or distinctions you learned when reading the stimulus. You do this with your mouse.</p>
<h3 class="left_hd" id="sy_8"><a href="content.html#syn_8"><span class="cap-bold">SECTION 3: SPEAKING</span></a></h3>
<p class="noindenta">The speaking section tests your ability to use spoken English in academic settings. This section contains six speaking tasks. Each task requires you to respond to a single question, a talk, conversation, or lecture. The tasks will require you to listen to a lecture or conversation or to read a short passage. You will then respond to a question. You may take notes and use them to help you respond to the questions.</p>
<p class="indentz">Your speaking proficiency is evaluated on the general fluency and accuracy with which you use the English language.</p>
<p class="indentz">The speaking section lasts 20 minutes. You are given 45 to 60 seconds to respond to each question. Before responding to questions, you will be given 15 to 20 seconds to think about how you will respond to the question. A clock appears on the screen to help you manage your time.</p>
<h3 class="left_hd" id="sy_9"><a href="content.html#syn_9"><span class="cap-bold">SECTION 4: WRITING</span></a></h3>
<p class="noindenta">The writing section tests your ability to perform the writing tasks that are typically required in college courses.</p>
<p class="indentz">In the iBT, you will respond to two writing prompts. There are two types of writing tasks, an integrated essay task and an independent writing task.</p>
<p class="indentz">The integrated essay task combines the language skills of reading, listening, and writing.</p>
<p class="indentz">You will read a short passage, hear a short lecture on the topic, and then write an essay in response to a specific set of directions for the essay. You may take notes and use them to help you write your essay. You will have 20 minutes to plan and write your essay.</p>
<p class="indentz">The independent writing task asks you to give your opinion on a familiar topic. You will have 30 minutes to plan and write your essay.</p>
<p class="indentz">A clock appears on the screen to help you manage your time as you complete your essays.</p>

<p class="noindent">The paper-based ITP TOEFL is a timed test that consists of three sections. It is administered in two forms: Level 1 (Intermediate to Advanced) and Level 2 (High Beginning to Intermediate). Throughout the years, the Educational Testing Service has determined which questions from previously administered TOEFLs are appropriate for each of the two TOEFL levels. The Level 1 TOEFL is longer than the Level 2 test, but each form of the test has the same types of questions. Section One tests Listening Comprehension, Section Two, Structure and Written Expression, and Section Three, Reading Comprehension. Here is the format of each section:</p>

<p class="noindenta">This section of the TOEFL tests your ability to understand spoken American English. After you hear taped conversations you will answer questions.</p>
<p class="left_hd"><span class="bold">Short Conversations</span></p>
<p class="noindenta">Part A contains short dialogs between two people followed by a question about what the people said in their conversation. They may have different purposes for speaking to each other. A speaker may give advice, apologize, or ask for information. Generally, key information is found in the second speaker’s sentence. You will need to understand the meaning of the conversation and also the context, such as the time or place in which it could occur. The correct choice is the one that directly answers the question.</p>

<p class="list_a">(D) She had to buy the door.</p>
<p class="indentt">The correct choice is <span class="bold">(B)</span>. Since the doors were locked when she arrived, she could not have gone shopping. Note that the other choices use words heard in the conversation. Choices that contain such words are usually not correct. Part A contains samples of informal American English. Idiomatic expressions and two-word verbs are common in this part.</p>
<p class="left_hd"><span class="bold">Extended Conversations</span></p>
<p class="noindenta">In Part B you will hear extended conversations between two or more people, a student and either a professor or a campus service provider. Usually, there are two conversations, and the language is more formal. After each conversation, there are between three and four spoken questions about its content. Choose your answer from among the four choices that appear in your test booklet.</p>
<p class="indentz">The extended conversations and minitalks (see below) are generally preceded by an introductory statement that tells you the context for the conversation. Pay particular attention to this information as it prepares you for what follows.</p>
<p class="left_hd"><span class="bold">Minitalks</span></p>
<p class="noindenta">Part C contains short presentations given by a single speaker. There are usually three. The English in this section is generally more academic, typical of English lectures that take place in a university or college setting. There are generally three lectures followed by four to five spoken questions about its content. You may take notes while you listen and refer back to them when you answer the questions. Choose your answer from among the four choices that appear in your test booklet. Look at the example of the minitalk below.</p>

Welcome to this tour of one of the nation’s most important cities, Chicago. Before we begin, I’d like to give you some background information that will make the tour more enjoyable for you. The city was founded in 1837. Its strategic location on Lake Michigan quickly made it the center of commerce for the Midwest section of the country. It currently is the third largest metropolitan area in the United States. The city’s site is generally level, built mostly on a glacial plain. The narrow Chicago River extends one mile inland from Lake Michigan, where it splits, dividing the city into North, West, and South sides. Chicago’s weather is subject to rapid changes, but generally the climate is cold and windy in the winter, and hot and humid in the summer.</p></td></tr>

Listen carefully and try to remember what you hear.</p>
<h3 class="left_hd" id="sy_12"><a href="content.html#syn_12"><span class="bold">SECTION 2: STRUCTURE AND WRITTEN EXPRESSION</span></a></h3>
<p class="noindenta">This section contains two types of questions, both designed to test your ability to recognize correct style and grammar in written English. The sentences are academic; ones that you typically find in college-level texts, journals, and encyclopedias. The sentence topics include the social sciences, physical and life sciences, and the humanities.</p>
<p class="left_hd"><span class="bold">Structure</span></p>
<p class="noindenta">The structure questions test your ability to recognize correct structure and word order. These questions consist of a sentence with one or more words missing. You must make the choice that best completes the sentence. Here is an example of this type of question.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Y<span class="ssmallcaps">OU WILL SEE</span>:</p>
<p class="block">________ a short time after the Civil War, Atlanta has become the principal center of transportation, commerce, and finance in the southeastern United States.</p>

<p class="indentt">The correct choice is <span class="bold">(C)</span>. The other choices make the sentence incorrect or awkward.</p>
<p class="left_hd"><span class="bold">Written Expression</span></p>
<p class="noindenta">The written expression questions test your ability to recognize errors in grammar or expression. These questions consist of complete sentences with four underlined words or phrases. You must identify the underlined part of the sentence that needs to be changed in order to make the sentence correct. An example follows.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Y<span class="ssmallcaps">OU WILL SEE</span>:</p>

<p class="indentt">The correct choice is <span class="bold">(D)</span>. <span class="italic">Flexibility</span>, a noun, appears where an adjective must occur. In addition to inappropriate parts of speech, be sure to check for missing words and extra words that are inappropriate for the context.</p>
<h3 class="left_hd" id="sy_13"><a href="content.html#syn_13"><span class="bold">SECTION 3: READING COMPREHENSION</span></a></h3>
<p class="noindenta">Good reading skills and an ample vocabulary are keys to doing well on all sections of the TOEFL. In this section of the TOEFL, these skills are specifically tested. Many TOEFL test takers complain that they do not have enough time to carefully answer all questions in this section. It is very important that you follow the instructions in this book, so that you will use all the allotted time to your advantage.</p>
<p class="left_hd"><span class="bold">Reading Comprehension Items</span></p>
<p class="noindenta">Your ability to read and understand college-level reading material is tested on this part of the TOEFL. You will find five or six reading passages, each followed by nine to eleven questions. You must work quickly and efficiently. Here is a sample passage.</p>

<p class="noindentt">Y<span class="ssmallcaps">OU WILL SEE</span>:</p>
<p class="indent1">According to the passage, what is focal length?</p>
<p class="list_aa">(A) A curved surface that refracts light</p>
<p class="list_aa">(B) The distance from the focal plane to the lens</p>
<p class="list_aa">(C) Adjustment by the muscles that alters lens curvature</p>
<p class="list_aa">(D) The degree that light rays of different colors are bent by the lens</p>
<p class="indentt">This is a factual question. The information needed to answer this question is directly stated in the text. Choice <span class="bold">(B)</span> is the correct answer. Some questions will ask you to draw conclusions based on material in the passage; others will ask about the main idea of a selection. Some may even ask what information does not appear in the passage.</p>
<p class="left_hd"><span class="bold">Vocabulary Items</span></p>
<p class="noindenta">The vocabulary questions in this section test your English vocabulary. There are between 12 and 17 questions focusing on specific words from the reading passage. Each word is taken from a specific line in the text; the line is referred to in the question. You must choose the word that has the same meaning from among the four choices given. Here’s an example from the previous text.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Y<span class="ssmallcaps">OU WILL SEE</span>:</p>
<p class="indent1">The word “distortion” in line 12 is closest in meaning to</p>
<p class="list_aa">(A) classification</p>
<p class="list_aa">(B) deformation</p>
<p class="list_aa">(C) reaction</p>
<p class="list_aa">(D) reflection</p>
<p class="indentt">The word that is the closest in meaning to the tested word, <span class="bold">distortion</span><span class="italic">,</span> is choice <span class="bold">(B)</span>. Additional hints for vocabulary questions can be found in Chapter 2.</p>
<p class="left_hd"><span class="bold">Cohesion Items</span></p>
<p class="noindenta">Another type of question that is used to test reading comprehension is called cohesion. Cohesion occurs when elements of a passage are linked to other elements. Cohesion allows the author to refer to previously mentioned information, and it allows the reader to keep previously mentioned information in mind while continuing to read the passage. To understand cohesion when it is used, one must understand the passage. Thus, TOEFL uses cohesion to test reading comprehension. Cohesion items typically test object pronouns (it, they, them) and demonstrative pronouns (this, these, those). Here is an example of a question that involves cohesion.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Y<span class="ssmallcaps">OU WILL SEE</span>:</p>
<p class="indent1">The word “This” in line 12 refers to</p>
<p class="list_aa">(A) surface</p>
<p class="list_aa">(B) adjusting</p>
<p class="list_aa">(C) light</p>
<p class="list_aa">(D) bending</p>
<p class="indentt">The word that “this” refers to is <span class="bold">bending</span>, option <span class="bold">(D)</span>. A typical version of the TOEFL will contain about five such items, or an average of one per passage.</p>
<p class="left_hdx" id="sy_14"><a href="content.html#syn_14"><span class="bold">SOME HELPFUL HINTS FOR BOTH FORMATS OF THE TOEFL</span></a></p>
<p class="noindenta">You can get most of the answers to your questions about the TOEFL at <span class="italic"><a href="http://www.ets.org/toefl">www.ets.org/toefl</a></span>.</p>
<p class="indentz">Information on testing centers, practice questions, and general descriptions of the TOEFL can be found at the official TOEFL website.</p>
<p class="indentz">On all parts of the TOEFL, be sure to answer all questions. On the iBT, you are penalized for not answering questions. On multiple-choice test items, if you must guess, choose (B) or (C), since they are slightly more likely to be the correct response to the question than (A) or (D).</p>
<p class="indentz">On the iBT, some questions will have more than one answer, particularly if the question deals with factual information presented as a series in the passage or text. A box under a question may tell you to “Click on two answers.” You may also have to manipulate data with the mouse. For example, you may be given a series of events to place in a specific order. You will click on the sentences and drag them to the appropriate slots that appear on the test item screen.</p>
<p class="indentz">Because the iBT requires a greater variety of response formats, always read the directions for each test item carefully. Ask yourself, “What do I need to do here?”</p>
<p class="indentz">Manage your time wisely! Both the ITP TOEFL and iBT are timed. The amount of time available is stated at the beginning of each section. If you are taking the ITP TOEFL, be sure to wear a watch (deactivate any sounds your watch may make before entering the test session) and be aware of the time you have remaining. No watches are allowed in the room for the iBT. Whether you are taking the iBT or the ITP TOEFL, you should become familiar with the directions and the examples for each section before you take the tests.</p>
<p class="indentz">Remember, when time has expired on a section, you may not return to it. Work quickly and accurately. If it seems obvious to you that you will not have enough time to finish a section of the TOEFL, GUESS answers (B) or (C).</p>
<p class="indentz">In the reading section of the iBT, you may skip questions, or go back and change answers. However, do not waste time doing this unless you are fairly certain that you have made a mistake! You cannot return to questions in a previous part once you have clicked on <span class="bold">Continue</span> after the last question in that part. Change your answer only if you find a better answer.</p>
<p class="indentz">Prepare yourself for the test. Being well prepared will give you the confidence you need to achieve the very best result for you. In addition to this book, <span class="italic">Barron’s</span> <span class="italic">TOEFL iBT (Internet Based Test)</span> provides you with practical hints designed to help you maximize your TOEFL score, a <span class="captial">CD-ROM</span> that simulates the experience of taking the iBT, and academic skills hints, including tips on note taking, paraphrasing, summarizing, and synthesizing.</p>
