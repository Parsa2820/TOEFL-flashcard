<p class="noindenta">Developing a good English vocabulary is the most important way to prepare for the vocabulary you will see and hear on the TOEFL. It is also a good way to prepare for the test generally. In addition to developing a good English vocabulary, it is very important to know the kind of vocabulary you will see on the TOEFL and to understand how it is tested.</p>
<p class="indentz">The reading section of the iBT contains approximately three to five passages with 12–14 questions for each passage. In the ITP, there are four to five reading passages and up to 50 questions. It is important for you to remember that your general vocabulary is tested in all sections of the TOEFL. However, it is in this section of the TOEFL where your knowledge of specific vocabulary items is tested.</p>
<p class="indentz">Passages from which vocabulary questions are drawn are written in a formal, academic style, typical of most college- or university-level texts and journals. The topics of these passages are those a first-year college student in North America would be likely to encounter. The topics come from such areas as the Natural Sciences, Business, Liberal Arts, and the Social Sciences. Some passages contain references to North American places and personalities. Others will refer to historical events and may include dates. It is important for you to understand that your knowledge of these North American places and personalities is never tested on the TOEFL. You do not have to be familiar with the content of the passages to be successful on this section of the TOEFL.</p>
<p class="left_hdx" id="sy_15"><a href="content.html#syn_15"><span class="bold">SAMPLE QUESTIONS</span></a></p>
<p class="noindent">The following passage and the questions that follow are used to illustrate and discuss the types of reading comprehension questions and tasks that you will find on the TOEFL. First, as a warm-up, you will read a sample passage for the ITP and work through the test questions. Then you will read a sample iBT passage and work through those questions.</p>
<p class="tab_block11z">Through a somewhat controversial process, Hawaii was the last territory to become a state. In 1842, the United States recognized the Kingdom of Hawaii as an independent country. In subsequent years, Americans and other foreign groups moved to the islands. They began to influence local politics. In 1887, Hawaiian King Kalakaua gave the United States exclusive rights to use Pearl Harbor as a naval base in exchange for certain trading privileges. [A <img alt="image" src="Images/box.jpg"/>] After the King died, his sister, Queen Liliuokalani, followed him to the throne. In 1894, a bloodless revolution led by American businessmen removed her from office. She was replaced by Stanford B. Dole. With the support of the Americans running the local government, Hawaii became a U.S. territory in 1900. [B <img alt="image" src="Images/box.jpg"/>] In 1959, the U.S. Congress approved legislation permitting Hawaii to convert to statehood. [C <img alt="image" src="Images/box.jpg"/>] Shortly afterward, Hawaiians voted almost 17 to 1 in favor of statehood. [D <img alt="image" src="Images/box.jpg"/>]</p>
<p class="list_ab">1. What does the passage mainly discuss?</p>
<p class="listb2ax"><img alt="image" src="Images/a.jpg"/>  Democracy in Hawaii</p>
<p class="listb2ax"><img alt="image" src="Images/b.jpg"/>  The history of Hawaiian monarchs</p>
<p class="listb2ax"><img alt="image" src="Images/c.jpg"/>  The evolution of Hawaii’s political status</p>
<p class="listb2ax"><img alt="image" src="Images/d.jpg"/>  American military control in Hawaii</p>
<p class="noindentaa">On the ITP TOEFL, you would darken the oval containing the letter <span class="bold">(C)</span> on your answer sheet.</p>
<p class="list_ab">2. The word “controversial” is closest in meaning to</p>
<p class="listb2ax"><img alt="image" src="Images/a.jpg"/>  adversarial</p>
<p class="listb2ax"><img alt="image" src="Images/b.jpg"/>  remarkable</p>
<p class="listb2ax"><img alt="image" src="Images/c.jpg"/>  gratifying</p>
<p class="listb2ax"><img alt="image" src="Images/d.jpg"/>  debatable</p>
<p class="noindentaa">This type of vocabulary item is typically used on the ITP TOEFL. The correct response is <span class="bold">(D)</span>.</p>
<p class="list_ab">3. The word “They” in the passage refers to</p>
<p class="listb2ax"><img alt="image" src="Images/a.jpg"/>  the United States</p>
<p class="listb2ax"><img alt="image" src="Images/b.jpg"/>  Americans and other foreign groups</p>
<p class="listb2ax"><img alt="image" src="Images/c.jpg"/>  in subsequent years</p>
<p class="listb2ax"><img alt="image" src="Images/d.jpg"/>  the islands</p>
<p class="noindentaa">This is an antecedent question. The item tests whether you understand what <span class="bold">they</span> refers to. The correct answer is <span class="bold">(B)</span>.</p>
<p class="list_ab">4. Look at the phrase “in exchange for” in the passage. In saying that the United States got exclusive access to Pearl Harbor “in exchange for certain trading privileges,” the author means the United States:</p>
<p class="listb2ax"><img alt="image" src="Images/a.jpg"/>  traded access to its markets for a naval base in Hawaii.</p>
<p class="listb2ax"><img alt="image" src="Images/b.jpg"/>  offered to rent the land it needed for a base in Hawaii.</p>
<p class="listb2ax"><img alt="image" src="Images/c.jpg"/>  absorbed Hawaii by granting it membership in the union.</p>
<p class="listb2ax"><img alt="image" src="Images/d.jpg"/>  was excluded by the Hawaiian king from Hawaiian markets.</p>
<p class="noindentaa">This is a whole phrase item. It tests whether you can separately understand the words in a group and then assemble them to arrive at an understanding of their meaning as a group. One clue to the meaning of this phrase is the word <span class="bold">exchange</span>. Since you are already familiar with exchanging money or exchanging addresses, you can probably guess that this has something to do with a two-way transfer—in this case, the right to use some land in Hawaii for access to U.S. markets. Once you have pieced together the larger context, it is easier to see that the correct response is <span class="bold">(A)</span>, <span class="bold">traded access to its markets for a naval base in Hawaii</span>.</p>
<p class="list_ab">5. According to the passage, which of the following is true about King Kalakaua?</p>
<p class="listb2ax"><img alt="image" src="Images/a.jpg"/>  He was replaced by Stanford B. Dole.</p>
<p class="listb2ax"><img alt="image" src="Images/b.jpg"/>  He made a trade agreement with the United States.</p>
<p class="listb2ax"><img alt="image" src="Images/c.jpg"/>  He welcomed foreign groups into the island.</p>
<p class="listb2ax"><img alt="image" src="Images/d.jpg"/>  He supported bloodless revolution.</p>
<p class="noindentaa">This is an example of a fact question. The response to the question is directly stated in the passage. You would darken circle <span class="bold">(B)</span>, since he was the leader of Hawaii who gave the United States exclusive military rights in exchange for a trade agreement.</p>
<p class="list_ab">6. Why does the author mention Americans and foreign groups in the passage?</p>
<p class="listb2ax"><img alt="image" src="Images/a.jpg"/>  They exerted a powerful influence in local politics.</p>
<p class="listb2ax"><img alt="image" src="Images/b.jpg"/>  They promoted trade between Hawaii and other countries.</p>
<p class="listb2ax"><img alt="image" src="Images/c.jpg"/>  They approved legislation giving Hawaii its statehood.</p>
<p class="listb2ax"><img alt="image" src="Images/d.jpg"/>  They supported Queen Liliuokalani’s plan to remain an independent nation.</p>
<p class="noindentaa">This item requires you to identify the author’s purpose for mentioning a specific fact in the passage. You would darken circle <span class="bold">(A)</span>, since the foreign groups that arrived in Hawaii did, indeed, exert great political power in local Hawaiian politics.</p>
<p class="list_ab">7. Find the phrase “in favor of” in the passage. In saying that “Hawaiians voted 17 to 1 in favor of statehood,” the author means that they:</p>
<p class="listb2ax"><img alt="image" src="Images/a.jpg"/>  supported independence.</p>
<p class="listb2ax"><img alt="image" src="Images/b.jpg"/>  voted against statehood.</p>
<p class="listb2ax"><img alt="image" src="Images/c.jpg"/>  wanted to join the union.</p>
<p class="listb2ax"><img alt="image" src="Images/d.jpg"/>  became a favorite resort.</p>
<p class="noindentaa">Here, you would darken circle <span class="bold">(C)</span>, <span class="bold">wanted to join the union</span>. In the passage, the word <span class="bold">favor</span> is a good clue to the meaning of the whole phrase, as is the adjoining phrase <span class="bold">voted almost 17 to 1</span>. This phrase strongly suggests that a vote has been taken and that the Hawaiians supported statehood by the margin given. Therefore, <span class="bold">in favor of</span> must indicate a positive vote, or formal support for a particular proposition or candidate.</p>
<p class="indentz">Examine the task below. In this type of task, you must insert the sentences into the appropriate place in the passages. Your choices are marked with a box [<img alt="image" src="Images/box.jpg"/>].</p>
<p class="list_ab">8. Look at the four squares [<img alt="image" src="Images/box.jpg"/>] that show where the following sentence could be inserted into the passage</p>
<p class="center"><span class="italic">In so doing, it became the fiftieth state.</span></p>
<p class="listv">Where could the sentence best be added? (A), (B), (C), or (D)</p>
<p class="noindentaa">The correct placement for this sentence is [<span class="bold">D</span> <img alt="image" src="Images/box.jpg"/>].</p>
<p class="list_ab">9. An introduction for a short summary of the passage appears below. Complete the summary by choosing three of the six choices that best summarize the information in the passage. Some sentences do not belong in the summary because they are not included in the passage or are minor points from the passage.</p>

<p class="listvv">•</p>
<p class="listvv">•</p>
<p class="listvv">•<br/><br/></p>
<p class="listb2ax"><img alt="image" src="Images/a.jpg"/>  Hawaii’s climate played a major role in its acceptance of statehood. Its agricultural products were sought by many nations around the world.</p>
<p class="listb2ax"><img alt="image" src="Images/b.jpg"/>  After the death of Hawaiian King Kalakaua, and the ousting of Queen Liliuokalani, foreign interests became intensely involved in the political matters of the island.</p>
<p class="listb2ax"><img alt="image" src="Images/c.jpg"/>  Largely due to American influence in local politics, the United States recognized Hawaii as an independent nation just before achieving statehood.</p>
<p class="listb2ax"><img alt="image" src="Images/d.jpg"/>  An American businessman seized the opportunity that weak leadership presented and led a peaceful movement to remove Queen Liliuokalani from her position of power.</p>
<p class="listb2ax"><img alt="image" src="Images/e.jpg"/>  Due to the political power that the Americans had in local government, a very close relationship formed with the United States that permitted the suggestion of statehood for the island nation.</p>
<p class="listb2ax"><img alt="image" src="Images/f.jpg"/>  Because of the agreements that were made between Hawaii and the United States, Pearl Harbor was able to play an important role in World War II.</p>
<p class="indentz">The best sentences to be added to the summary are <span class="bold">(B)</span>, <span class="bold">(D)</span>, and <span class="bold">(E)</span>. You would darken those three circles.</p>

<p class="noindent">Each TOEFL vocabulary item refers you to a word (or phrase, such as a two-word verb) in a specific line of the passage. You are then asked to identify a synonym for that word. These choices are marked by the letters: (A), (B), (C), and (D). <span class="italic">You must identify the word among the choices that is closest in meaning to the word in quotation marks.</span> Words that are very close or identical in meaning are called <span class="bold">synonyms</span>. Now go back and examine question 2.</p>
<p class="indentz">This question is typical of vocabulary items on the ITP TOEFL. The topic is from U.S. history and the question contains a single word in quotation marks. The correct answer is <span class="bold">(D)</span>, <span class="bold">debatable</span>. <span class="bold">Debatable</span> is a synonym for <span class="bold">controversial</span>. As in this example, the word you select is the one that best matches the meaning of the word in quotation marks. Note that all four of the choices make sense in the sentence and that they make use of other information given in the passage. Many vocabulary questions are written so that the context of the sentence or the passage seldom helps you to determine the meaning of the word. Therefore, you must know the word in order to make the correct choice.</p>
<p class="indentz">Because the context may not help you, you should simply look at the underlined word and choose its synonym from among the four choices, then check to see if the synonym makes sense in the sentence in which it appears. It is best for you to use this strategy because it will prevent frustration and save time. You will need this time for the reading comprehension questions. Remember, on the TOEFL, (B) and (C) answers tend to be used slightly more than (A) and (D). So choose (B) or (C) when guessing. Also remember that answer choices that contain the same prefix or suffix, or are pronounced like the underlined word are seldom the correct answers.</p>
<p class="indentz">Note that choice <span class="bold">(A)</span>, <span class="bold">adversarial</span>, sounds and has letters similar to <span class="bold">controversial</span>. Such words are not usually the correct choice. Such words are often used to distract you. Unless you are sure of the answer, do not choose these words.</p>
<p class="noindent">Let’s see how to use our strategy with a sample item. Look at question 2 again, noting the word in quotation marks. Do not reread the line referred to or the paragraph that contains it. Instead, read the four choices and make your selection of the best synonym.</p>
<p class="block1z">This is an example of how you should read vocabulary items.</p>
<p class="block1z">+ + + + + “controversial” + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +</p>
<p class="block1z">+ + + + + + + + +</p>
<p class="block1z">(A) adversarial</p>
<p class="block1z">(B) remarkable</p>
<p class="block1z">(C) gratifying</p>
<p class="block1z">(D) debatable</p>
<p class="indentz">You should pay attention only to the word in quotation marks and the choices that follow. If you know the meaning of the word and recognize the synonym, there is no need to read the context in which it is used. If you do not know the meaning of the word, you must make an educated guess about its synonym. The context will not usually help you to determine the correct choice. All of the choices from the example above fit into the original context.</p>
<p class="block1">Through a somewhat <span class="italic">adversarial</span> process, Hawaii was the last territory to become a state.</p>
<p class="block1">Through a somewhat <span class="italic">remarkable</span> process, Hawaii was the last territory to become a state.</p>
<p class="block1">Through a somewhat <span class="italic">gratifying</span> process, Hawaii was the last territory to become a state.</p>
<p class="block1">Through a somewhat <span class="italic">debatable</span> process, Hawaii was the last territory to become a state.</p>
<p class="indentz">These sentences show that the context does not help you to determine the meaning of the word being tested. If you simply cannot decide on the answer, you can refer to the sentence in which it is used. In the case of the phrasal examples above, there may be some clues in the context that can help you tease out the meaning of the phrase, as shown above. It may also help you to remember any previous experience you have had with the word. However, you are often better off ignoring the context if you know the answer, and you should not waste a lot of time analyzing contextual information. If you cannot make sense of any of the clues available in the context, or recall the phrase from another context, simply make a guess and move on.</p>
<p class="indentz"><span class="italic">Essential Words for the TOEFL</span> gives you additional practice in ignoring the context of vocabulary items on the TOEFL through the matching exercises that are found in each lesson. In these exercises, you are given a word followed by four possible synonyms. Your task is to mark the letter of the correct synonym. The following matching exercise uses the example previously introduced.</p>
<p class="block1">Controversial</p>
<p class="block1">(A) adversarial</p>
<p class="block1">(B) remarkable</p>
<p class="block1">(C) gratifying</p>
<p class="block1">(D) debatable</p>
<p class="noindenta">R<span class="ssmallcaps">EMEMBER</span></p>
<p class="tab_leftaz">• Do not waste time rereading the context in which the word is used. Look only at the word in quotation marks and search for a synonym among the answer choices.</p>
<p class="tab_leftaz">• Analyze words quickly. Spending too much time studying word roots, prefixes, and suffixes can cause you to misuse valuable time.</p>
<p class="tab_leftaz">• Work quickly, but carefully. You should try to spend only 30 seconds on each vocabulary question.</p>
<p class="tab_leftaz">• Words that contain similar sounds and spelling are usually not the correct answer.</p>
<p class="tab_leftaz">• Always answer every question. If you must guess, choose (B) or (C) as your answer. Your score on Section 3 is based solely on the number of correct answers.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="bold">Timing and checking your work</span>. Depending on the format of the TOEFL you are taking, you will have between 31 and 55 minutes on the ITP and 60 minutes on the standard iBT to complete this section. If you take the long iBT, you will have 100 minutes to complete this section. Some test takers report that they do not have enough time to complete the reading questions, so you should work quickly. If you follow the strategies in this book, you will have adequate time to complete the reading section of the TOEFL.</p>
<p class="indentz">Manage your time wisely! If you finish early, use the <span class="bolditalic">Review</span> icon to go back to test items and check your answers. Checking your responses will allow you to identify and correct any errors. Also, because vocabulary items do not require you to reread and comprehend the entire passage, they can be checked more rapidly than reading comprehension items. After you have checked your responses to the vocabulary items, if you still have time, beginning with the first passage, check your answers to the reading comprehension test items.</p>
