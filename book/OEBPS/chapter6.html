<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Essential Words for the TOEFL</span> provides you with a 39-item TOEFL practice test for the reading section of the iBT. This section tests reading comprehension, including specific vocabulary items and whole phrases or words in combination. The ITP TOEFL contains 40–50 items in the Reading Comprehension section, while the iBT contains 36 to 70 items in this section. This test contains the kinds of passages that are likely to be found on the iBT. Each passage is followed by 12 questions. The iBT version contains the same kinds of items found on the paper-based version, plus some additional item formats. Thus, this test will be helpful to you regardless of which version of the TOEFL you plan to take.</p>
<p class="indentz">After you have studied the vocabulary lessons in this book, take the test in a single sitting. Using a watch or a clock, time yourself when taking the test. Write down on a piece of paper your start time and the time at which you will stop. Allow yourself 60 minutes to take the test. Use the full 60 minutes. If you finish early, go back and check your work, following the helpful strategies and hints for test takers covered in Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 of this book.</p>
<p class="indentz">When taking the test, follow the directions for each question. For multiple-choice questions, circle the correct answer in your book. For other types of questions, do as indicated. Although this test is not administered on a computer, every effort has been made to make it like the iBT version of the TOEFL.</p>
<p class="indentz">After you take the test, score it using the answer key provided in this book. For each vocabulary item you answer incorrectly, look up the word tested in this book. Try to understand why you made the mistake so you won’t make it again. If necessary, look up the tested word or the options in your English dictionary. This will provide you with additional information on the meaning of the word in different contexts, and perhaps another example sentence demonstrating its usage.</p>
<p class="indentz">For information on interpreting your performance and converting it to the TOEFL scale, follow the directions in Scoring Your iBT Practice Reading Test at the end of this chapter.</p>
<p class="indentz">Now, review Chapters 1 and 2; then, write down your starting time, and take the TOEFL Practice Test, Reading Comprehension section.</p>

Read and follow the directions for each test question carefully before you answer.

<p class="blocka">Over the years, nursing’s status as a profession has been elevated in the western world from one of a menial, female dominated profession, requiring little education, to a highly respected job, requiring specific skills and knowledge.</p>

<p class="listb2a6"><img alt="image" src="Images/a.jpg"/>  Despite the emerging importance of the nursing profession, modern programs designed to professionally prepare nurses for the workplace are largely relegated to small, private, hospital-based nursing schools.</p>
<p class="listb2a6"><a href="#sq_30" id="qs_30"><img alt="image" src="Images/b.jpg"/></a>  Long promoted by Florence Nightingale, the idea that nursing not only involved considerable knowledge of a large body of information, but also specific skills in order to deliver healthcare to patients, finally gained acceptance in the western world.</p>
<p class="listb2a6"><a href="#sq_31" id="qs_31"><img alt="image" src="Images/c.jpg"/></a>  The “germ theory” generated an explosion of the medical knowledge base which, in turn, created the need for an increase in the number of doctors and skilled healthcare providers.</p>
<p class="listb2a6"><img alt="image" src="Images/d.jpg"/>  Due to the efforts of professionals such as Florence Nightingale, the idea that nursing is a demanding profession, requiring specific knowledge and training, has spread across the entire globe.</p>
<p class="listb2a6"><img alt="image" src="Images/e.jpg"/>  Nightingale insisted that a patient’s needs could only be met if a team relationship was nurtured between nurses and doctors.</p>
<p class="listb2a6"><a href="#sq_32" id="qs_32"><img alt="image" src="Images/f.jpg"/></a>  Nursing education programs have now expanded from small, hospital-based nursing schools to universities and colleges, giving further recognition to the idea that nursing is a key component of the healthcare system.</p>

<p class="blocka1"><a id="qs_52"/>•</p>
<p class="listb2a6"><a href="#qs_50" id="sq_50"><img alt="image" src="Images/a.jpg"/></a>  Innovations in engineering permitted buildings to be constructed upon steel frames, which allowed for an even distribution of weight, which consequently made construction of taller buildings possible.</p>
<p class="listb2a6"><img alt="image" src="Images/b.jpg"/>  Skeletal framing was first used in Chicago, where the Western Union Telegraph Building was constructed in 1873 and the Farmer’s National Bank in 1908.</p>
<p class="listb2a6"><img alt="image" src="Images/c.jpg"/>  Modern social and economic attitudes have encouraged the designers of modern day skyscrapers to build even higher edifices.</p>
<p class="listb2a6"><a href="#qs_51" id="sq_51"><img alt="image" src="Images/d.jpg"/></a>  A pivotal change of thought about building construction was introduced by Louis Sullivan, whose “form follows function” approach was adopted by many architects who desired to construct functional buildings.</p>
<p class="listb2a6"><a href="#qs_52" id="sq_52"><img alt="image" src="Images/e.jpg"/></a>  In the early stages, architects were limited by antiquated construction methods and traditional building styles found in Europe.</p>
<p class="listb2a6"><img alt="image" src="Images/f.jpg"/>  In the modern age, most architects first considered the decorative design of their buildings, rather than their function.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Essential Words for the TOEFL</span> contains a practice test. This test is provided so you may determine what effect the study of this book has had on your knowledge of TOEFL vocabulary and on your ability to answer vocabulary questions in the TOEFL format. The test will also provide you with a fairly accurate estimate of how you would do on Section 3 of the TOEFL.</p>
<p class="indentz">To score your iBT Practice Reading Test, please follow the procedures described below. Since this is an eBook, you will have to use a separate piece of paper.
</p>
<p class="listaa">1. Go to the key (list of correct answers) for the test. It is located at the top of this page.</p>
<p class="lista">2. Score the test using the key. Place a C next to each correct answer in the book.</p>
<p class="lista">3. Count the number of correct answers and write that number in the space called Number Correct below.</p>
<table style="margin-top:1.2em; margin-bottom:1.2em;" width="100%">
<col width="10%"/>
<col width="30%"/>

<tr><td/><td valign="top"><p class="tab_leftxxx">Number Correct</p></td>

<td valign="top"><p class="tab_left">___________________</p></td>
<td valign="top"><p class="tab_left">___________________</p></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p class="lista">4. Now, go to the Score Conversion Tables, and Find your Number Correct Score in the left column. Using a ruler or straightedge, draw a line under your score and across to the center column to find the iBT Scale Score that corresponds to your Number Correct Score. Write that number in the space above.</p>
<p class="lista">5. Now, in the right column, find the ITP TOEFL Scale Score that corresponds to your Number Correct Score. Write that number in the space above where it says ITP TOEFL Scale Score.</p>
<p class="indentt1">Now let’s practice these procedures in order to verify that you are following them correctly. Suppose on the Practice iBT you answered 25 questions correctly. According to the chart, your iBT Scale Score would be 20. Your reading score is approximately 25 percent of your iBT score.</p>
<p class="indentz">When you take the TOEFL at an official administration, if your score on the Reading section is different from your Scale Score on the iBT or the ITP TOEFL Reading Practice Test, the difference is probably due to the fact that on any given day and on any given set of items your performance will vary slightly. However, your Scale Score will probably not vary by more than three points from the score you got here. So, you can feel some degree of confidence that the score you obtained here is similar to the score you would obtain on the real TOEFL Reading test, if you took it today, after using this book.</p>
